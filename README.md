Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are frequently contaminated by noise, including powerline interference, baseline wander, and muscle artifacts, which can obscure critical cardiac information and impede accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using the Blackman window was designed. FIR filters are commonly employed for ECG denoising due to their inherent stability and linear phase characteristics. The filter was implemented using a Dadda multiplier, Carry Save Adder (CSA), and D Flip-Flop to optimize hardware efficiency and computational speed. The Blackman window ensures a smooth frequency response, minimizing spectral leakage while preserving diagnostic features such as the P, QRS, and T waves. A three-stage notch filter was also cascaded to remove the powerline interference. A direct form FIR filter was designed as it is easier to implement and consumes low power. The design was modeled, simulated in Verilog and verified using MATLAB, demonstrating effective noise suppression and hardware feasibility for low-power biomedical applications.
